Approach to the coding task

1. Understanding the existing system: 

    - `UpdateQuality` function and the `Items` property. 
 
    - Spent time understanding how the `UpdateQuality` function lowers the values of `SellIn` and `Quality` for each item in the inventory.

2. Identifying item categories: 

    - The inventory has four different categories of items: "Aged Brie", "Sulfuras", "Backstage passes", and "Conjured". 
    - Each category follows different rules for adjusting their `SellIn` and `Quality` values. 

3. Creating unit tests: 

To safeguard against potential errors, create unit tests that cover the functionality of each item category. 

    - This will include scenarios for each item's behavior before and after 
    the `SellIn` date has passed, as well as checks to ensure `Quality` 
    never becomes negative and never exceeds 50 (except for "Sulfuras").

4. Refactoring the code: 

    The `UpdateQuality` function might be 
    complex due to the various rules for different items. (Nestling hell)

    - Refactor the function by breaking it into smaller functions, each handling a specific type of item. 
      This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
    - Add some tests for each new method

5. Adding functionality for Conjured items: 

    - The system needs to support a new category of items called "Conjured". 

    - Implement a function or set of conditions within the `UpdateQuality` method that handles "Conjured" items, taking into account that the 
    `Quality` degrades twice as fast as normal items.

6. Testing the new functionality: 

    - Add unit tests specifically for "Conjured" items. Make sure the `Quality` is decreasing at 
        the correct rate (twice as fast) and other rules are followed correctly.

7. Code review and refactoring:

    - Once all new functionality is implemented and all tests are passing, review the entire 
    code for any potential improvements. Refactor where necessary 
    to make the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.

8. Documentation: 

    - Finally, document your changes and write descriptive comments for the functions and complex code sections.
